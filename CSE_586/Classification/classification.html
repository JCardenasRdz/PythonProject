<em>Due Wed Feb 8 at 5pm (files listed below in DropBox; write up hardcopy in Lydia's mailbox)</em>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project, you will design three classifiers: a naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron 
classifier, and a logistic regression classifier. You will test your first two classifiers on an 
image data set: a set of scanned handwritten digit images. The third classifier will be evaluated on 
synthetic data. Even with simple features, your classifiers will 
be able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.

<p>Optical character recognition (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a>) 
is the task of extracting text from image sources. The first
data set on which you will run your classifiers is a collection of handwritten numerical digits (0-9). 
This is a very commercially useful technology, similar to the technique used by the 
US post office to route mail by zip codes. 
There are systems that can perform with over 99% classification accuracy 
(see <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/index.html">LeNet-5</a> for an example system in action).

<p>
</p><p><strong>What to submit:</strong> You will fill in portions of <code><a href="docs/naiveBayes.html">naiveBayes.py</a></code>,
<code><a href="docs/perceptron.html">perceptron.py</a></code>, and <code><a href="docs/dataClassifier.html">dataClassifier.py</a></code>

and create your own file, <code>logit.py</code>. Please submit these files along with a write up directly to the DropBox. We ask that you also hand-in a hard copy of the write up to Lydia.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p> To try out the classification pipeline, run <code><a href="docs/dataClassifier.html">dataClassifier.py</a></code> 
from the command line. This 
will classify the digit data using the default classifier (<code>mostFrequent</code>) which blindly classifies every example
with the most frequent label.

<pre>python dataClassifier.py  </pre>

<p>As usual, you can learn more about the possible command line options by running: 
    
<pre>python dataClassifier.py -h  </pre>

<p> We have defined some simple features for you. Our simple feature set includes one feature for
each pixel location, which can take values 0 or 1 (off or on). The features are encoded as 
a <code>Counter</code> where keys are feature locations (represented as (column,row)) and 
values are 0 or 1. The face recognition data set has value 1 only for those pixels identified 
by a Canny edge detector.

<p> Implementation Note: You'll find it easiest to hard-code the binary feature assumption. 
If you do, make sure you don't include any non-binary features. Or, you can write your code
more generally, to handle arbitrary feature values, though this will probably involve
a preliminary pass through the training set to find all possible feature values (and you'll
need an "unknown" option in case you encounter a value in the test data you never saw
during training).

<h2>Naive Bayes</h2>

<p> A skeleton implementation of a naive Bayes classifier is provided for you in 
<code><a href="docs/naiveBayes.html">naiveBayes.py</a></code>. 
You will fill in the <code>trainAndTune</code> function, the 

<code>calculateLogJointProbabilities</code> function and the 
<code>findHighOddsFeatures</code> function.

<h4>Theory</h4>

<p>A naive Bayes classifier
 models a joint distribution over a label <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img1.png"
 ALT="$Y$"> and a set of observed random variables, or <I>features</I>, 
<IMG
 HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img2.png"
 ALT="$\{F_1, F_2, \ldots F_n\}$">,
 using the assumption that the full joint distribution can be factored as follows (features are conditionally independent given the label):
 <BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<IMG
 SRC="images/img3.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
P(F_1 \ldots F_n, Y) = P(Y) \prod_i P(F_i \vert Y)
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>

<P>
To classify a datum, we can find the most probable label given the feature values for each pixel, using Bayes theorem:
<P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img4_new.png"
 ALT="\begin{eqnarray*}
P(y \vert f_1, \ldots, f_m) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P(f_1, \ldots, f_m \...
...
&amp;=&amp; \textmd{arg max}_{y} P(y) \prod_{i = 1}^m P(f_i \vert y)
\end{eqnarray*}"></DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P></P>

<P>
Because multiplying many probabilities together often results in underflow, we will instead compute <em><b>log
probabilities</b></em> which have the same argmax:

<P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img5.png"
 ALT="\begin{eqnarray*}
\textmd{arg max}_{y} log(P(y \vert f_1, \ldots, f_m) &amp;=&amp; \te...
...{arg max}_{y} (log(P(y)) + \sum_{i = 1}^m log(P(f_i \vert y)))
\end{eqnarray*}"></DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P></P>



<p> To compute logarithms, use <code>math.log()</code>, a built-in Python function.

<h4>Parameter Estimation</h4>
Our naive Bayes model has several parameters to estimate.  One
parameter is the <em><b>prior distribution</b></em> over labels (digits, or face/not-face),

<IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img6.png"
 ALT="$P(Y)$">.

<P>
We can estimate <IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img6.png"
 ALT="$P(Y)$"> directly from the training data:
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img7.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\hat{P}(y) = \frac{c(y)}{n}
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>
where <IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img8.png"
 ALT="$c(y)$"> is the number of training instances with label y and
n is the total number of training instances.

<P>
The other parameters to estimate are the <em><b>conditional probabilities</em></b> of
our features given each label y: 

<IMG
 WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img9.png"
 ALT="$P(F_i \vert Y = y)$">. We do this for each
possible feature value (<IMG
 HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="TOP"
 SRC="images/img10.png"
 ALT="$f_i \in {0,1}$">).
<P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<A NAME="empirical"></A><IMG
 SRC="images/img11.png"
 ALT="\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{P}(F_i=f_i\vert Y=y) &amp;=&amp; \frac{c(f_i,y)}{\sum_{f_i}{c(f_i,y)}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}"></DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P></P>
where <IMG
 WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img12.png"
 ALT="$c(f_i,y)$"> is the number of times pixel <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img13.png"
 ALT="$F_i$"> took value <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img14.png"
 ALT="$f_i$">
in the training examples of label y.

</p><h4>Smoothing</h4>
Your current parameter estimates are <I>unsmoothed</I>, that is, you are
using the empirical estimates for the parameters <IMG
 WIDTH="55" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img15.png"
 ALT="$P(f_i\vert y)$">.  These
estimates are rarely adequate in real systems.  Minimally, we need to
make sure that no parameter ever receives an estimate of zero, but
good smoothing can boost accuracy quite a bit by reducing
overfitting.


<P>
In this project, we use <em>Laplace smoothing</em>, which adds <em>k</em> counts to every possible observation value:
<p>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">    
<IMG
 SRC="images/imgsmoothlaplace.png"
 ALT="$P(F_i=f_i\vert Y=y) = \frac{c(F_i=f_i,Y=y)+k}{\sum_{f_i}{(c(F_i=f_i,Y=y)+k)}}$">
</DIV>
<p>
If k=0, the probabilities are unsmoothed.  As k grows larger, the probabilities are 
smoothed more and more. You can use your validation set to determine a good value 
for k.  <strong>Note</strong>: don't smooth P(Y).

<p><em><strong>Question 1</strong></em>

Implement <code>trainAndTune</code> and <code>calculateLogJointProbabilities</code> in <code><a href="docs/naiveBayes.html">naiveBayes.py</a></code>. 
In <code>trainAndTune</code>, estimate conditional probabilities from the training data for each possible value
of <em>k</em> given in the list <code>kgrid</code>.  
Evaluate accuracy on the held-out validation set for each <em>k</em> and choose
the value with the highest validation accuracy.  In case of ties,
prefer the <em>lowest</em> value of <em>k</em>.  Test your classifier with:


<pre>python dataClassifier.py -c naiveBayes --autotune </pre>



<p><strong>Hints and observations:</strong>
<ul>
    <li> The method <code>calculateLogJointProbabilities</code> uses the conditional probability tables constructed by 
<code>trainAndTune</code> to compute the log posterior probability for each label y given a feature vector. The comments of the method describe the data structures of the input and output.
    <li> You can add code to the <code>analysis</code> method in <code><a href="docs/dataClassifier.html">dataClassifier.py</a></code> to explore the mistakes that your classifier is making.  This is optional.
    <li> When trying different values of the smoothing parameter <em>k</em>, think about the number of times you scan the training data. Your code should save computation by avoiding redundant reading.
    <li> To run your classifier with only one particular value of <em>k</em>, remove the <code>--autotune</code> option.  This will ensure that <code>kgrid</code> has only one value, which you can change with <code>-k</code>.
    <li> Using a fixed value of <em>k=2</em> and 100 training examples, you should get a validation accuracy of about 69% and a test accuracy of 55%.
    <li> Using <code>--autotune</code>, which tries different values of <em>k</em>, you should get a validation accuracy of about 74% and a test accuracy of 65%.
    <li> Accuracies may vary slightly because of implementation details.  For instance, ties are not deterministically
        broken in the <code>Counter.argMax()</code> method.
    <li> To run on the face recognition dataset, use <code>-d faces</code> (optional).

</ul>


</p><h4>Odds Ratios</h4>
One important tool in using classifiers in real domains is being able
to inspect what they have learned.  One way to inspect a naive Bayes
model is to look at the most likely features for a given label.

<P>
Another, better, tool for understanding the parameters is to look at <I>odds ratios</I>.  For each pixel
feature <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img13.png"
 ALT="$F_i$"> and classes <IMG
 WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img23_new.png"
 ALT="$y_1, y_2$">, consider the odds ratio:
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img24.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\mbox{odds}(F_i=on, y_1, y_2) = \frac{P(F_i=on\vert y_1)}{P(F_i=on\vert y_2)}
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>

<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>
This ratio will be greater than one for features which cause belief in
<IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img25_new.png"
 ALT="$y_1$"> to increase relative to <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img26_new.png"
 ALT="$y_2$">.

<P> The features that have the greatest impact at classification time are those with both a high
probability (because they appear often in the data) and a high odds ratio (because they strongly bias
one label versus another).

<P><em><strong>Question 2 </strong></em>
Fill in the function <code>findHighOddsFeatures(self, label1, label2)</code>. 
It should return a list of the 100 features with highest odds ratios for <code>label1</code>
over <code>label2</code>.
The option <code>-o</code> activates an odds ratio analysis.
Use the options <code>-1 label1 -2 label2</code> to specify which labels to compare. Running the following command will show you the 100 pixels that best distinguish between a 3 and a 6.


<pre>python dataClassifier.py -a -d digits -c naiveBayes -o -1 3 -2 6  </pre>

Use what you learn from running this command to answer the following question. Which of the following images best shows those pixels
which have a high odds ratio with respect to 3 over 6? (That is, which of these is most like the output from the command you just ran?)

<h2>Perceptron</h2>

<br/>
A skeleton implementation of a perceptron classifier is provided for
you in <code><a href="docs/perceptron.html">perceptron.py</a></code>. You will fill in the 
<code>train</code> function, and the <code>findHighWeightFeatures</code> function.

<P>
Unlike the naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron does not use
probabilities to make its decisions.  Instead, it keeps a
weight vector <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img31_new.png"
 ALT="$w^y$"> of each class <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img32_new.png"
 ALT="$y$"> (<IMG
  WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
  SRC="images/img32_new.png"
  ALT="$y$"> is an identifier, not an exponent).  Given a feature list <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img33.png"
 ALT="$f$">,
the perceptron compute the class <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img32_new.png"
 ALT="$y$"> whose weight vector is most similar
to the input vector <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img33.png"
 ALT="$f$">.  Formally, given a feature vector <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img33.png"
 ALT="$f$"> (in our case, a map from pixel locations to indicators of whether they are on), we score each class with:

<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img34.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\mbox{score}(f,y) = \sum_i f_i w^y_i
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
Then we choose the class with highest score as the predicted label for that data instance.
In the code, we will represent <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img31_new.png"
 ALT="$w^y$"> as a <code>Counter</code>.

</p><h4>Learning weights</h4>
In the
basic multi-class perceptron, we scan over the data, one instance at a
time.  When we come to an instance <IMG
 WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img35.png"
 ALT="$(f, y)$">, we find the label with highest score:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img36.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
y' = \textmd{arg max}_{y''} score(f,y'')
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<P></P>

We compare <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img37.png"
 ALT="$y'$"> to the true label <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img32_new.png"
 ALT="$y$">.  If <IMG
 WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img38.png"
 ALT="$y' = y$">, we've gotten the
instance correct, and we do nothing.  Otherwise, we guessed <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img37.png"
 ALT="$y'$"> but
we should have guessed <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img32_new.png"
 ALT="$y$">.  That means that <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img31_new.png"
 ALT="$w^y$"> should have scored <IMG
  WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
  SRC="images/img33.png"
  ALT="$f$"> higher, and <IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img39.png"
 ALT="$w^{y'}$"> should have scored
<IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img33.png"
 ALT="$f$"> lower, in order to prevent this error in the future.  We update these two weight vectors accordingly:
<BR><P></P>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img40.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
w^y += f
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 SRC="images/img41.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
w^{y'} -= f
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<P></P>

<P>
Using the addition, subtraction, and multiplication functionality of the
<code>Counter</code> class in <code><a href="docs/util.html">util.py</a></code>, the perceptron updates should be
relatively easy to code.  Certain implementation issues have been
taken care of for you in <code><a href="docs/perceptron.html">perceptron.py</a></code>, such as handling iterations
over the training data and ordering the update trials.  Furthermore,
the code sets up the <code>weights</code> data structure for you.  Each
legal label needs its own <code>Counter</code> full of weights.


<P>

<em><strong>Question 3 </strong></em>  Fill in the <code>train</code> method in <code><a href="docs/perceptron.html">perceptron.py</a></code>.  Run your code with:

<pre>python dataClassifier.py -c perceptron </pre>

<p><strong>Hints and observations:</strong>
<ul>
  <li> The command above should yield validation accuracies in the range between 40% to 70%
and test accuracy between 40% and 70% (with the default 3 iterations).  These ranges are wide because the perceptron is a lot more sensitive to the specific choice of tie-breaking than naive Bayes.
  <li> One of the problems with the perceptron is that its performance is sensitive to
several practical details, such as how many iterations you train it for, and the order you 
use for the training examples (in practice, using a randomized order works better
than a fixed order).  The current code uses a default value of 3 training iterations. You
can change the number of iterations for the perceptron with the <code>-i iterations</code>

option. Try different numbers of iterations and see how it influences the performance.
In practice, you would use the performance on the validation set to figure out
when to stop training, but you don't need to implement this stopping criterion for
this assignment.
</ul>

</p><h4>Visualizing weights</h4>
Perceptron classifiers, and other discriminative methods, are often criticized 
because the parameters they learn are hard to interpret.  To see a demonstration 
of this issue, we can write a function to find features that are characteristic of
one class. (Note that, because of the way perceptrons are trained, it is not
as crucial to find odds ratios.)

<P>
<em><strong>Question 4 </strong></em> Fill in <code>findHighWeightFeatures(self, label)</code> in <code><a href="docs/perceptron.html">perceptron.py</a></code>. 
It should return a list of the 100 features with highest weight for that label. You can display the 100 pixels with the largest weights 
using the command:

<pre>python dataClassifier.py -c perceptron -w  </pre>

Use this command to look at the weights, and answer the following true/false question. Which of the following sequence of weights is
most representative of the perceptron?

<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>
Hopefully, you found the skeleton code for the naive Bayes and perceptron classifiers helpful.  
Now, you will implement logistic regression without skeleton code.  You are free to take inspiration from the way the naive Bayes and perceptron code was organized.

Use lecture slides and the Mitchell Chapter on <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook/NBayesLogReg.pdf">Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression</a> as a guide for implementation.

<em><strong>Question 5 </strong></em> Implement Logistic Regression.  Put your implementation in one file called <code>logit.py</code> For simplicity, you don't have to use an actual convergence criterion,  you can just do a fixed number of gradient updates (and describe your approach in the writeup). Your implementation of Logistic Regression must work on both data sets.  No fiddling with the parameter settings when you change data sets!   
</p>
<p>
For your write up:<br><br>

A.  Write out the form of the logistic model you are using (what is the equation for the distribution?, what are the features)?<br><br>
B.  What parameters did you have to set and what values did you set them to?<br><br>
C.  What (if any) data transformations did you have to use?  <br><br>
D. Answer the following questions, for both datasets:
<ol> 
<li>What was the training and test accuracy?</li>
<li>Interpret the feature weights: which features are most predictive? Provide some evidence (for example, a plot of some sort) to support your claim.</li>
<!--
    <ol> 
    <li>Which features are most predictive? Provide some evidence to support your claim. </li>
    <li>Draw a x-y plot that represents your classifier.  Only include predictive features.  (You can free-hand sketch this, you don't have to create a plot of the actual data)</li>
    </ol> 
-->
</ol>

</p>


<p>
The End. Hope if feels great to be an expert on classification!
